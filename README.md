    content: How long does it take for newborn jaundice to go away?
  output:
    text: >-
      Newborn jaundice, also known as neonatal jaundice, is a common condition in newborns where the yellowing of the skin and eyes occurs due to an elevated level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that forms when red blood cells break down. In most cases, newborn jaundice resolves on its own without any specific treatment.

      The duration of newborn jaundice can vary depending on several factors such as the underlying cause, gestational age at birth, and individual variations in bilirubin metabolism. Here are some general guidelines:

      1. Physiological jaundice: This is the most common type of newborn jaundice and usually appears within 24-72 hours after birth. It tends to peak between the second and fifth day of life and gradually improves over the next week or two. By the time the baby is one week old, the jaundice should have mostly resolved.
      2. Breast milk jaundice: This type of jaundice occurs in breastfed babies and may appear later than physiological jaundice, typically between the fifth and fourteenth day of life. It tends to persist for a longer duration but usually resolves within six weeks after birth.
      3. Pathological jaundice: This type of jaundice is less common and occurs due to an underlying medical condition that affects bilirubin metabolism or liver function. The duration of pathological jaundice depends on the specific cause and may require treatment.

      It's important for parents to monitor their newborn's jaundice closely and seek medical advice if the jaundice progresses rapidly, becomes severe, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as poor feeding, lethargy, or excessive sleepiness. In these cases, further evaluation and management may be necessary.
      Remember that each baby is unique, and the timing of jaundice resolution can vary. If you have concerns about your newborn's jaundice, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.

Introducing OpenBioLLM-7B: A State-of-the-Art Open Source Biomedical Large Language Model


OpenBioLLM-7B is an advanced open source language model designed specifically for the biomedical domain. Developed by Saama AI Labs, this model leverages cutting-edge techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of biomedical tasks.

üè• **Biomedical Specialization**: OpenBioLLM-7B is tailored for the unique language and knowledge requirements of the medical and life sciences fields. It was fine-tuned on a vast corpus of high-quality biomedical data, enabling it to understand and generate text with domain-specific accuracy and fluency.

üéì **Superior Performance**: With 7 billion parameters, OpenBioLLM-7B outperforms other open source biomedical language models of similar scale. It has also demonstrated competitive results compared to larger proprietary & open-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo 1106 & Meditron-70B on biomedical benchmarks.

üß† **Advanced Training Techniques**: OpenBioLLM-7B builds upon the powerful foundations of the **Mistral-7B-v0.1** and [Starling-LM-7B-beta](Nexusflow/Starling-LM-7B-beta) models. It incorporates the same dataset and fine-tuning recipe as the Starling model, along with a custom diverse medical instruction dataset and a novel merge method. Key components of the training pipeline include:

# Clinical Entity Recognition

OpenBioMed-7B can perform advanced clinical entity recognition by identifying and extracting key medical concepts, such as diseases, symptoms, medications, procedures, and anatomical structures, from unstructured clinical text. By leveraging its deep understanding of medical terminology and context, the model can accurately annotate and categorize clinical entities, enabling more efficient information retrieval, data analysis, and knowledge discovery from electronic health records, research articles, and other biomedical text sources. This capability can support various downstream applications, such as clinical decision support, pharmacovigilance, and medical research.

**Advisory Notice!**¬†

While OpenBioLLM-7B leverages high-quality data sources, its outputs may still contain inaccuracies, biases, or misalignments that could pose risks if relied upon for medical decision-making without further testing and refinement. The model's performance has not yet been rigorously evaluated in randomized controlled trials or real-world healthcare environments.

Therefore, we strongly advise against using OpenBioLLM-7B for any direct patient care, clinical decision support, or other professional medical purposes at this time. Its use should be limited to research, development, and exploratory applications by qualified individuals who understand its limitations.
OpenBioMed-7B is intended solely as a research tool to assist healthcare professionals and should never be considered a replacement for the professional judgment and expertise of a qualified medical doctor.

Appropriately adapting and validating OpenBioLLM-7B for specific medical use cases would require significant additional work, potentially including:

- Thorough testing and evaluation in relevant clinical scenarios
- Alignment with evidence-based guidelines and best practices
- Mitigation of potential biases and failure modes
- Integration with human oversight and interpretation
- Compliance with regulatory and ethical standards

Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for personal medical needs.
